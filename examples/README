This folder contains examples to run and perform calculations with MutateX.
These were included in our published paper. Every folder contains:
    * one or more mutatex runs; in each of them, the run.sh file contains the
      necessary command(s) to rerun the calculation if need be
    * one or more analysis folders; these contains the analysis plots produced
      with MutateX and a script do.sh that contains the commands used to generate
      them
