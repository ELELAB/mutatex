MutateX is designed to run on Linux and MacOS. It requires Python 2.7 and >=3.7
and the following Python packages:

setuptools

matplotlib
numpy
scipy

openpyxl

The most convenient way to install MutateX is by creating a Python virtual 
environment in which all the requirements will be installed. In order to do
this, you should have the virtualenv and pip packages installed in your system
as well.

1) if you have git, download the git codebase or clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/ELELAB/mutatex.git

2) First create the virtual environment using the virtualenv package and 
activate it:

	virtualenv mutatex-env
	. mutatex-env/bin/activate

3) install mutatex using the included setup file. All the requirements will
will be automatically installed

	cd mutatex
	python setup.py install 

4) The mutatex scripts should now be available to run

MutateX also requires a version of FoldX to be present on your system. Please
